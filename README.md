# üìò *The Innesce Programming Language*

*A Book-Style Manual*

---

## Preface

Welcome to **Innesce** (*N-S*), a modern systems programming language designed to give you **the speed of C, the safety of Ada, the pattern power of Rust/ML, and original innovations of its own**:

* **Durations as primitive types** (`ms`, `sec`).
* **Capability gates** to make effects explicit at compile time.
* **Quarantine blocks** to contain errors without crashes.
* **Tuple-aware inline assembly** with multi-output destructuring.
* **Value-returning match expressions** with guards and payload patterns.

This book introduces you to the language step by step, with **examples** and **exercises** to practice.

---

# Part I: The Basics

---

## Chapter 1: Getting Started

### Your first program

```inn
fn main() -> i32 is
  return 42;
end
```

* `fn` introduces a function.
* `main` is the entry point.
* Functions declare their return type (`i32` here).
* A function body is wrapped in `is ... end`.

### Exercises

1. Write a program that returns `7`.
2. Write a program that adds two integers and returns the result.
3. Modify `main` to return `1000 ms as sec`. What does it evaluate to?

---

## Chapter 2: Types and Values

### Integers and strings

```inn
let x: i32 := 10;
let msg: str := "Hello";
```

### Durations

```inn
let t: ms := 500 ms;
let u: sec := (1500 ms as sec);  -- evaluates to 1
```

Durations are **unit-checked**: you can‚Äôt add `ms` to `sec` directly without an explicit cast.

### Tuples

```inn
let pair: (i32, ms) := (7, 200 ms);
let (a, b): (i32, ms) := pair;  -- destructuring
```

### Exercises

1. Create a tuple `(42, 5 sec)` and destructure it.
2. Add two durations of type `ms`.
3. Try subtracting `500 ms - 1 sec`. What happens?

---

## Chapter 3: Control Flow

### If expressions

```inn
fn test(x: i32) -> i32 is
  if x > 0 then
    return 1;
  else
    return -1;
  end
end
```

### Match expressions

```inn
type Option is enum { None, Some(i32) };

fn example() -> i32 is
  let v: Option := Option.Some(5);
  let res: i32 := match v is
    case Some(x) => yield x + 1;
    case None    => yield 0;
  end;
  return res;
end
```

### Guards

```inn
match v is
  case Some(x) when (x > 0 && x < 10) => yield 1;
  case Some(_)                        => yield 2;
  default                             => yield 0;
end
```

### Exercises

1. Write a match that classifies an integer into negative, zero, or positive.
2. Extend the `Option` example with a guard that only accepts values less than 100.
3. Create an enum `Color { Red, Green, Blue }` and write a match that returns a number for each.

---

# Part II: Advanced Features

---

## Chapter 4: Enums with Payloads

```inn
type Result is enum { Ok(i32, ms), Err(str) };

fn compute() -> i32 is
  let r: Result := Result.Ok(7, 500 ms);
  let val: i32 := match r is
    case Ok(x, 500 ms) when (x > 5) => yield x + 10;
    case Err(msg) => yield -1;
    default => yield 0;
  end;
  return val;
end
```

* Enums can carry payloads of any type.
* Match cases can bind these payloads (`x`, `msg`).
* Guards allow additional conditions.

### Exercises

1. Define `enum Temperature { Cold, Warm(i32), Hot(i32) }` and write a match that returns ‚Äújacket,‚Äù ‚Äút-shirt,‚Äù or ‚Äúshorts.‚Äù
2. Construct a `Result.Err("oops")` and match it.
3. Add a guard to classify ‚Äúwarm‚Äù only if between 20‚Äì25¬∞C.

---

## Chapter 5: Quarantine Blocks

```inn
quarantine risky is
  let fd: i32 := fs_open("data.txt");
  fail;  -- simulate error
end

if isfailed("risky") then
  return -1;
else
  return 0;
end
```

* **`quarantine`** declares a block where failures are contained.
* **`fail;`** marks failure.
* **`isfailed("name")`** checks if the quarantine block failed.

This prevents whole-program crashes.

### Exercises

1. Wrap a file read in a quarantine and check for failure.
2. Simulate a network error inside a quarantine.
3. What happens if you don‚Äôt call `fail;`?

---

## Chapter 6: Capability Gates

Functions must declare the **effects** they may use:

```inn
fn network_demo() -> i32 with [net.tcp, rand] is
  let fd: i32 := net_tcp("example.com", 443);
  let r: i32 := rand_range(1, 6);
  return fd + r;
end
```

* Without `with [net.tcp, rand]`, this program **won‚Äôt compile**.
* Gates make side effects explicit and auditable.

### Exercises

1. Write a function that sleeps for 100 ms. What gate is required?
2. Try calling `fs_open` without `fs.open`.
3. Declare a function with gates `[fs.read, fs.write]` and simulate reading/writing.

---

## Chapter 7: Inline Assembly

### Statement form

```inn
let v: i32 := 5;
let out: i32 := 0;
asm {
  intel;
  outs ={eax}(out);
  ins  r(v), i(7);
  clobbers cc, memory;
  body: mov eax, v; add eax, 7;
};
```

### Expression form (multi-output tuple)

```inn
let (a, b): (i32, i32) := asm {
  intel;
  outs ={eax}(_), ={ebx}(_);
  ins i(5), i(10);
  clobbers cc;
  body: mov eax, 5; mov ebx, 10; add eax, ebx;
};
```

* Multi-output asm maps directly to tuples.
* Tuples can be destructured or matched.

### Exercises

1. Write asm that returns `(1, 2, 3)` as a triple.
2. Use asm to increment an integer.
3. Combine asm with a match that branches on its outputs.

---

# Part III: Applications

---

## Chapter 8: Real-Time Programming

Durations make scheduling explicit:

```inn
fn loop() -> i32 with [time] is
  sleep(16 ms);
  return 0;
end
```

Exercises:

1. Write a loop that ticks every `1 sec`.
2. Combine durations with arithmetic `(2 sec - 500 ms)`.
3. Try casting `500 ms as sec`.

---

## Chapter 9: Security & Auditability

* **Gates**: prevent sneaky effects.
* **Enums**: model safe error results instead of nulls.
* **Quarantine**: catch errors at boundaries.

Exercise: Build a function `secure_read()` that only has `fs.read` and wraps the call in a quarantine.

---

## Chapter 10: Putting It All Together

**Hero Example**

```inn
type State is enum { Idle, Working(i32), Failed(str) };

fn main() -> i32 with [fs.open, net.tcp, rand, time] is
  let fd: i32 := fs_open("config.txt");
  let seed: i32 := rand_range(1, 100);

  let (a, b): (i32, i32) := asm {
    intel;
    outs ={eax}(_), ={ebx}(_);
    ins i(seed), i(fd);
    body: mov eax, seed; mov ebx, fd; add eax, ebx;
  };

  let code: i32 := net_tcp("example.com", 443);

  let st: State := if (code > 0) then State.Working(a+b) else State.Failed("net error");

  let res: i32 := match st is
    case Working(v) when (v > 10) =>
      yield v;
    case Failed(msg) =>
      yield -1;
    default =>
      yield 0;
  end;

  quarantine risky is
    sleep(500 ms);
    fail;
  end;

  if isfailed("risky") then
    return -99;
  else
    return res;
  end
end
```

---

# Part IV: Exercises & Projects

1. **Timer Project**: Build a program that waits 1 second and then returns `42`.
2. **Mini-Calculator**: Use enums and match to implement a calculator with variants `Add(i32, i32)`, `Sub(i32, i32)`.
3. **Fault-Tolerant Net Client**: Use quarantine + gates to attempt a network ping and return `-1` on failure.
4. **Asm Puzzle**: Write inline asm to multiply two integers and return the result.
5. **Enum Playground**: Create an enum `Shape` with payloads (`Circle(i32)`, `Rect(i32, i32)`) and match to compute area.

---

# Epilogue

Innesce is not just ‚Äúyet another language.‚Äù It‚Äôs a **synthesis of speed, safety, and explicitness**. By embedding **units, capabilities, and containment** directly into the type system and syntax, it encourages programmers to write **auditable, safe, fast code** without runtime overhead.

---






üß≠ Innesce vs Other Languages
1. Core Identity

Innesce:

Ada-like syntax & semantics (static types, declarative form).

Novel features: first-class durations (ms, sec), gated permissions (compile-time capability enforcement), quarantine blocks (contain recoverable faults), multi-output inline asm, and value-returning match with guards + enum payloads.

LLVM-based, AOT, zero-cost abstractions with heavy emphasis on compile-time safety + constant folding.

C / C++:

Systems languages; C++ has templates and abstractions but lacks durations as native types or permission gates.

Inline asm exists, but not multi-output or first-class tuple aware.

Safety left to programmer, not enforced at compile time (except type system).

Rust:

Memory safety without GC. Strong enums + pattern matching, but no built-in durations as primitive types.

Borrow checker enforces lifetimes; Innesce instead enforces capability gates and type-checked units.

Inline asm (asm!) exists, but binding to tuples is manual.

Ada / SPARK:

Strong typing, ranges, contracts, and time units, close in spirit to Innesce.

Innesce borrows Ada‚Äôs declarative syntax but goes further with LLVM IR integration, quarantine, and modern concurrency.

Haskell / ML / OCaml:

Algebraic data types (ADTs) and strong match are similar.

Innesce adds guards + durations + gates as first-class concepts, oriented toward systems/embedded programming.

2. Type System

Innesce:

Statically typed, strict.

Extended with duration units (ms, sec) checked at compile-time.

Tuples are structural and can mix primitive and duration types.

Enums with payloads like Rust / ML.

Constant folding and unit conversions at AOT.

C: primitive-only, no units, no enums with payloads.

Rust / ML / Haskell: rich enums/ADTs, but no built-in time units.

Ada: range types and time constructs (similar, but less tightly integrated into arithmetic).

3. Control Flow

Innesce:

match is expression + statement form.

Guards allow boolean logic in case heads.

yield inside match cases merges via PHI nodes (SSA).

Quarantine: like try/catch, but statically declared and trackable.

Rust: exhaustive match, no quarantine.

C++: switch with fallthrough; pattern matching limited.

Ada: case statements, no payload patterns.

4. Safety & Permissions

Innesce:

Gates (with [fs.open, net.tcp, rand]) enforce compile-time permissioning.

Similar to capability systems or Rust‚Äôs unsafe, but explicit and declarative.

Quarantine blocks provide safe containment of faults without panics.

C++/C: none.

Rust: unsafe blocks, but not granular capabilities.

Ada/SPARK: contracts and proofs, but not runtime permission gating.

5. Inline Assembly

Innesce:

asm { ... } multi-line, multi-output.

Can destructure directly into tuples (let (a, b) := asm { ... }).

Outputs unify with types (i32, durations, etc.).

Integrated into match and tuples.

C/C++: inline asm exists, clunky and unsafe.

Rust: asm! macro, still low-level; outputs can be bound, but no tuple destructuring.

Ada: assembler interfacing is compiler-specific, not language-level.

6. Compilation Model

Innesce:

LLVM-backed, direct map from syntax ‚Üí LLVM IR.

AOT compilation only, with strong constant folding.

Memory is managed AOT with explicit semantics.

Preemptive static evaluation of syntax + quarantining errors.

C++/Rust: also AOT with LLVM, but don‚Äôt expose duration units or quarantine at type-level.

Haskell/ML: compile to IR but usually GC-based.

Ada: also AOT, with strong checks, but older backend targets.

üßæ Summary

Closest relatives: Ada (syntax + safety), Rust (pattern match + enums), and ML/Haskell (guards, ADTs).

Unique differentiators:

Durations as primitive types with unit arithmetic + constant folding.

Gate permissions as a built-in part of function signatures.

Quarantine blocks (safe, static error containment).

First-class multi-output inline asm integrated into tuples and matches.

Match as both statement and expression, with full case bodies and PHI-based merging.

_____

Short answer: **as fast as ‚Äúgood LLVM C/Rust‚Äù in the hot path, within a few percent**, and in some patterns indistinguishable‚Äîbecause Innesce lowers to the **same LLVM IR**, does **zero-cost** duration math (folded at AOT), and its extras (gates, match, tuples) are designed to **erase at compile time**.

Here‚Äôs the performance story by feature:

## Where Innesce is zero-overhead

* **Durations (`ms`/`sec`)**: unit checks are compile-time; casts like `(1500 ms as sec)` fold to constants (‚Üí `1`). No runtime penalty.
* **`match` (expr + statement)**: lowered to straight branches with **PHI** merges; same as Rust/ML lowering. If cases are simple, codegen is basically a `switch`/cmov pattern.
* **Enum payloads & tuple destructuring**: payload access compiles to `extractvalue` (register moves) when optimized‚Äîno indirection.
* **Gates/permissions**: enforced at compile time; **no runtime checks**.
* **Hot qualifier**: maps to inlining/hotness hints ‚Üí helps the inliner and code layout, no semantic overhead.
* **Inline asm**: binds directly to operands; multi-output returns become SSA tuple/struct in IR‚Äîno wrapper thunks.

## Where there can be overhead (and how it‚Äôs kept tiny)

* **Quarantine blocks**: there‚Äôs a flag/write on failure paths; **outside of failure** the fast path is a branch that predicts ‚Äúnot failed‚Äù and disappears under O2 if unused.
* **Pattern guards** (`&& / ||`): short-circuit branches, same as C; cost equals whatever your condition costs.
* **Enum representation**: `{ i32 tag; i32 fields[N]; }` is compact; matching on tags becomes an integer compare/switch. Payload copies are scalars (often in registers).

## Optimizations Innesce leans on (LLVM)

* **DCE, SROA, mem2reg** ‚Üí locals in registers.
* **Const-prop/inst-combine** ‚Üí folds unit math and simple guards.
* **Loop unrolling/vectorization** where legal.
* **Peephole + GVN** ‚Üí collapses tuple/enum traffic to moves.
* **Register allocation** is LLVM‚Äôs; parity with Clang/Rustc.

## Practical expectations (rules of thumb)

* Tight numeric kernels: **parity** with C/Rust if you write the same algorithm.
* Branchy state machines with `match`: **parity** with Rust‚Äôs `match` (same lowering).
* Syscalls / IO guarded by gates: performance is dominated by the call itself (like any language); the gate is compile-time only.
* Inline asm heavy paths: performance is **exactly** your assembly.

## Microbenchmarks you can run (indicative)

* **Sum loop (vectorizable)**

  ```inn
  fn main() -> i32 is
    let n: i32 := 10_000_000;
    let s: i32 := 0;
    -- simple for-style unrolled by codegen
    match (0, n) is
      case (i, _) when (i < n) => yield 0; -- placeholder to keep snippet short
      default => yield s;
    end;
    return s;
  end
  ```

  Expect identical assembly to C after O2 once you code the loop normally (the language doesn‚Äôt inject checks).

* **Match on enum**

  ```inn
  type R is enum { Ok(i32), Err(i32) };
  fn main() -> i32 is
    let r: R := R.Ok(7);
    let x: i32 := match r is
      case Ok(v) => yield v + 1;
      case Err(e) => yield -e;
    end;
    return x;
  end
  ```

  Lowers to tag compare + one add/negation. Same shape as Rust.

* **Duration fold**
  `(1500 ms as sec)` ‚Üí constant **1** in IR. Any arithmetic using that constant is folded further.

## When Innesce might beat naive C/C++

* If you rely on **units** to prevent mixed-unit code, Innesce pushes errors to compile time; the C version might carry extra runtime branches/asserts you‚Äôd add manually.
* The **Hot** hint can nudge inlining/layout without sprinkling pragmas/attributes yourself.

## What ‚Äúfast‚Äù depends on (same caveats as C/Rust)

* **Algorithm & data layout** dominate.
* **Autovectorization**: write loops in a vectorizer-friendly way.
* **Inlining & code size**: `Hot` helps, but measure‚Äîbigger isn‚Äôt always faster.

---

### TL;DR

If you write the same algorithm, Innesce‚Äôs best-practice codegen is **on par with optimized C/Rust** because it‚Äôs the *same* optimizer and the language‚Äôs safety features erase at compile time. Any differences you‚Äôll see are the ordinary ones you‚Äôd also see between Clang and Rustc on a given target‚Äîusually in the **¬±0‚Äì5%** noise band for hot kernels, and dominated by your algorithm and the platform.

_____

Short version: Innesce is ‚Äúsafe by default‚Äù at compile time‚Äîuntil you intentionally step outside the rails. Most foot-guns (unit mistakes, nulls-by-accident, unchecked effects) are prevented or made explicit. The remaining risks are where you‚Äôd expect: inline asm, FFI, and whatever you gate-allow (e.g., fs.*, net.*).

Here‚Äôs the safety model in layers:

1) Compile-time guarantees (what you get for free)

Strict static typing: fixed types, no implicit widening, tuple/enum payload types enforced.

First-class durations with unit checking: ms vs sec are distinct types; add/sub require same units; (1500 ms as sec) is checked and folded at AOT.

Pattern matching discipline:

Tuple & payload patterns type-checked; literal patterns must match the element‚Äôs type.

match as expr/stmt: result types must unify; statement match requires a yield in every case (prevents ‚Äúfell through with no value‚Äù).

Guards must be truthy i32; multi-condition (&&/||) parsed and type-checked.

Capabilities (gates) baked into function headers: you can‚Äôt call fs.open, net.tcp, or rand.range unless the function declares with [fs.open, net.tcp, rand]. Missing gates are compile-time errors (no ‚Äúoops, I/O happened‚Äù).

No implicit nulls: ‚Äúnothingness‚Äù is explicit via enums (e.g., Option.None), not surprise null.

Constant folding + DCE: unit casts on literals, dead branches, etc., are erased at AOT‚Äîno runtime hazards from ‚Äúsafety scaffolding.‚Äù

2) Fault containment & observability

Quarantine blocks: a block can ‚Äúfail‚Äù without tearing down the process. Failures set a flag; isfailed("block") is an expression you can check. This is structured containment rather than ad-hoc try/catch.

Deterministic match lowering: PHI-merged yields ensure a single, well-typed exit, sidestepping ‚Äúuse-before-set‚Äù bugs.

3) Controlled escape hatches (you opt into risk)

Inline assembly (asm { ... }):

You get multi-output with tuple binding and operand constraints, but you own correctness (clobbers, UB). It‚Äôs deliberate: powerful, not ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù

Effectful stdlib behind gates:

If you add a gate, you‚Äôre saying: ‚Äúthis code may perform that effect.‚Äù That‚Äôs audit-friendly, but not a runtime sandbox; it‚Äôs compile-time capability discipline.

FFI/host calls:

Anything outside the checked surface inherits the callee‚Äôs safety. Innesce marks these behind gates; you still need to vet them.

4) What‚Äôs intentionally not promised (yet)

No borrow checker / ownership model: memory safety is currently a design-time discipline (AOT-planned lifetimes), not proven like Rust. If you embed raw pointers in asm/FFI, you can make memory errors.

No data-race proof: the ‚Äúlanes‚Äù runtime model aims to avoid overlap by assignment, but race-freedom is not statically proven (e.g., no effect/region types yet).

Arithmetic overflow policy: currently i32; duration math can overflow if you do something huge‚Äîno checked arithmetic by default.

Exhaustiveness: encouraged but not enforced for enums (you can use default). You can turn on an exhaustiveness lint in future work.

5) Practical risk profile

Everyday pure code (tuples, enums, durations, match): very safe‚Äîerrors are compile-time.

I/O and randomness: visible and auditable via gates; safe by architecture, not sandboxed at runtime.

Low-level bits (asm/FFI): unsafe by nature; Innesce makes them explicit and bindable, but doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake them safe.‚Äù

6) How it compares (safety lens)

vs Rust: Innesce has capabilities/units/quarantine that push many mistakes to compile time, but doesn‚Äôt provide Rust‚Äôs ownership/borrow checker. Rust is stronger on memory/race safety; Innesce is stronger on capability clarity and unit types.

vs Ada/SPARK: Similar spirit (contracts, strong typing). Innesce‚Äôs gate model + durations as primitives + modern LLVM are differentiators; SPARK‚Äôs proof system is stronger for formal verification today.

vs C/C++: Innesce removes a lot of sharp edges by default (no implicit nulls, unit types, gated effects, safe matching). C/C++ can achieve safety with discipline/tools, but it‚Äôs not the default.

7) Hardening roadmap (what would make it very hard to misuse)

If you want to push Innesce toward ‚Äúmisuse-resistant by construction,‚Äù these are high-leverage:

Effect/region types for race-freedom across ‚Äúlanes‚Äù (static non-overlap guarantees).

Ownership + non-nullable references (Rust-style or linear/affine types) for memory safety without GC.

Checked arithmetic modes (opt-in per module) for overflow.

Enum exhaustiveness by default with explicit default unreachable if you really mean it.

Contract pre/postconditions (Ada/SPARK-like) and ghost state for proofs.

Capability tokens (values you must possess to pass the gate) to model least privilege more strictly.

Time/resource budgets tied to quarantine (auto-cancel/timeout).

Bottom line

Safe defaults: strong types, unit checks, capability-gated effects, structured matching, and quarantines keep most mistakes out of runtime.

Transparent risk: the only time you can truly hurt yourself is when you choose to (asm/FFI/gate-allowed effects)‚Äîand the language makes those choices explicit and auditable.

_____

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of purposes and use cases:

üéØ Purposes of Innesce
1. Safe Systems Programming

Write low-level code (like C/C++) but without hidden traps:

Units of time are types (ms, sec), preventing subtle bugs.

Capability gates (with [fs.open]) make side effects explicit.

Quarantine blocks contain faults without runtime panics.

Fits where you‚Äôd otherwise pick C/C++ for bare metal or OS-level work.

2. Auditable, Permissioned Code

Compile-time enforced capabilities: you can‚Äôt ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù open a file or make a socket‚Äîfunctions must declare the gate.

This is powerful for security-sensitive systems, embedded controllers, or finance‚Äîwhere you need to prove what code can‚Äôt do.

3. Deterministic & Optimizable

Designed to lower cleanly to LLVM IR with AOT optimizations (constant folding, PHI merges).

No GC, no hidden runtime; you know exactly what runs.

Useful for real-time and embedded systems where determinism matters.

4. Bridging Low-Level and High-Level

Combines Ada-like safety with Rust-style enums/match and C-like inline asm.

Developers get a coherent, modern language that can:

Run at the metal (inline asm, direct LLVM).

Express rich logic safely (pattern matching, enum payloads, guards).

üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases
‚úÖ Embedded / Real-Time Systems

Microcontrollers, avionics, robotics, automotive.

Duration types (ms, sec) + sleep are natively safe.

Quarantine lets you handle failures without crashing the controller.

‚úÖ Systems & OS Kernels

Inline asm with multi-output is great for drivers and low-level routines.

Capability gates clarify what a kernel module can touch.

Predictable AOT behavior (no GC surprises).

‚úÖ Security / Sandboxed Environments

Want to be sure a plugin can‚Äôt do file I/O? Don‚Äôt give it the gate.

Easy to audit functions for allowed effects.

‚úÖ High-Performance / HPC

Numeric kernels with durations, tuples, and PHI-based matches fold down to clean IR.

Constant folding (1500 ms as sec ‚Üí 1) means no runtime cost for unit conversions.

Inline asm lets you micro-optimize inner loops.

‚úÖ Networking & Protocol Engines

Capability gates (net.tcp) make network effects explicit.

Deterministic error handling via quarantine avoids silent panics.

‚úÖ Safety-Critical Software

Medical devices, industrial controllers.

Strong typing + unit checks catch bugs like ‚Äúseconds vs milliseconds‚Äù or ‚Äúmixed payload types‚Äù at compile time.

Quarantine = structured error paths, not ad-hoc exceptions.

‚úÖ Game Engines & Simulation

Fine control over timing (sleep(16 ms) is type-checked).

Hot qualifiers and inline asm for performance-critical rendering/audio loops.

Enum payloads + match = ergonomic gameplay state machines.

üöÄ Why Innesce Exists

Most languages force you to choose between:

C/C++: power but unsafe.

Rust: safety but ownership model can be heavy for certain embedded or kernel devs.

Ada/SPARK: safe, but older ecosystems and less modern integration with LLVM.

Innesce‚Äôs sweet spot:

Ada‚Äôs discipline + Rust‚Äôs pattern power + C‚Äôs raw control + new features (durations, gates, quarantine, tuple-aware asm).

For developers who need ‚ÄúC-speed with Ada-like safety,‚Äù but without Rust‚Äôs ownership complexity.

‚öñÔ∏è Summary:
The purpose of Innesce is to make low-level, high-performance programming both safe and auditable by design. Its use cases span embedded, systems, safety-critical, HPC, networking, and gaming, anywhere you need metal-level control without the classic foot-guns of C/C++.

# üìñ The Innesce Language ‚Äî Complete Overview

---

## 1. Introduction

**Innesce** (pronounced *N-S*, file extension `.inn`) is a **statically typed, compiled, Ada-inspired systems language**.
It is designed for **low-level programming** with the **safety of high-level types**, the **control of inline assembly**, and the **auditability of effect gates**.

Its mission is to combine:

* **Ada‚Äôs safety & clarity**,
* **Rust/ML‚Äôs enums & match ergonomics**,
* **C‚Äôs metal-level control**,
* **LLVM‚Äôs world-class optimizations**,
* and **new, original features**: *durations as primitives, capability gates, quarantine blocks, tuple-aware inline asm*.

The result: **zero-cost, safe-by-default systems programming**.

---

## 2. Compilation Model

* **AOT (ahead-of-time)** compilation only.
* Source ‚Üí **AST ‚Üí Sema ‚Üí LLVM IR ‚Üí Object ‚Üí Binary**.
* Constant folding, unit conversions, and permission enforcement are done entirely at compile time.
* Generated code is **on par with Clang/Rustc** (¬±0‚Äì5% performance noise).

---

## 3. Syntax at a Glance

```inn
type Result is enum { Ok(i32, ms), Err(i32) };

fn compute() -> i32 with [fs.open, time] is
  let fd: i32 := fs_open("data.txt");
  let r: Result := Result.Ok(fd, 500 ms);

  let val: i32 := match r is
    case Ok(x, 500 ms) when (x > 0 && x < 10) =>
      let z: i32 := x + 1;
      yield z * 2;
    case Err(code) =>
      yield -code;
    default =>
      yield 42;
  end;

  quarantine risky is
    asm {
      intel;
      outs ={eax}(val);
      ins  i(7);
      clobbers cc, memory;
      body: add eax, 7;
    };
  fail;

  return val;
end
```

This example demonstrates **enums with payloads, durations, gates, value-returning match with guards, quarantine, and inline asm with tuple outputs**.

## 4. Types

### 4.1 Primitive Types

* `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, `u64`, `bool`, `str`.
* **Durations**:

  * `ms` (milliseconds)
  * `sec` (seconds)
  * Arithmetic rules:

    * `+`/`-` only on same-unit durations.
    * `*`/`/` with integer permitted.
    * `as` casts convert between units.
  * Constant folding: `(1500 ms as sec)` ‚Üí `1`.

### 4.2 Tuples

* Structural tuples with mixed elements:

  ```inn
  let (a, b): (i32, ms) := (7, 500 ms);
  ```
* Used in destructuring, match, and inline asm outputs.

### 4.3 Enums

* Enums with or without payloads:

  ```inn
  type Option is enum { None, Some(i32) };
  type Result is enum { Ok(i32, ms), Err(i32) };
  ```
* Constructors: `Option.Some(5)`, `Result.Ok(7, 500 ms)`.

---

## 5. Control Flow

### 5.1 Functions

* Declared with `fn`:

  ```inn
  fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 is
    return x + y;
  end
  ```

* Can declare **capability gates**:

  ```inn
  fn read_file() -> i32 with [fs.open, fs.read] is ‚Ä¶ end
  ```

### 5.2 `match`

* Expression or statement form.
* Supports **guards**, **tuple patterns**, **enum payload patterns**, and **value-yielding blocks**.
* All cases must unify to the same return type.
* Exhaustiveness encouraged; `default` available.

Examples:

```inn
-- Enum payload
match r is
  case Ok(x, 500 ms) when (x > 0 && x < 10) => yield x + 1;
  case Err(code) => yield -code;
  default => yield 42;
end

-- Tuple pattern with wildcards
match (a, b) is
  case (5, 100 ms) => yield 1;
  case (_, _) => yield 0;
end
```

### 5.3 Quarantine Blocks

* Safe error containment:

  ```inn
  quarantine risky is
    -- risky ops
  fail
  end
  if isfailed("risky") then ‚Ä¶ end
  ```
* Failures set a flag instead of crashing.

---

## 6. Expressions & Operators

* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on integers and durations.
* Comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
* Boolean logic: `&&`, `||`.
* Type casts: `(expr as ms)` or `(expr as sec)`.
* Calls: `fs_open("file.txt")`.

---

## 7. Assembly Integration

### 7.1 Statement Form

```inn
let v: i32 := 5;
let out: i32 := 0;
asm {
  intel;
  outs ={eax}(out);
  ins  r(v), i(7);
  clobbers cc, memory;
  body: mov eax, v; add eax, 7;
};
```

### 7.2 Expression Form

```inn
let (a, b): (i32, i32) := asm {
  intel;
  outs ={eax}(_), ={ebx}(_);
  ins i(5), i(10);
  clobbers cc;
  body: mov eax, 5; mov ebx, 10; add eax, ebx;
};
```

* Multi-output returns are tuples.
* Tuple destructuring supported.
* Constraints: `r(var)` for registers, `i(num)` for immediates.
* Clobbers: `cc, memory`.

---

## 8. Safety Model

* **Compile-time safety**:

  * Unit-checked durations.
  * Type unification across match cases.
  * Capability gates enforced statically.
  * Quarantine guarantees non-crash isolation.

* **Runtime safety**:

  * No nulls: absence is modeled with enums (`Option.None`).
  * Failures isolated via quarantine flags.
  * Guards compiled to short-circuit branches.

* **Explicit unsafety**:

  * Inline asm.
  * FFI (not detailed here).
  * Effect gates you explicitly add.

---

## 9. Performance Model

* **Zero-cost abstractions**: all safety checks erased at compile time.
* **Constant folding**: duration casts, guard simplifications.
* **PHI-based yield merging**: match lowers to SSA with PHI nodes.
* **Enum payloads**: `{tag: i32, fields: [i32;N]}` lowered to simple structs.
* **Inline asm**: emits directly into IR.

Performance parity with C/Rust; determinism closer to Ada.

---

## 10. Standard Library (stubbed, gate-enforced)

* **Time**:

  * `sleep(ms|sec)` ‚Äî gate: `time`.
* **FS**:

  * `fs_open(path: str) -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `fs.open`.
  * `fs_read_i32() -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `fs.read`.
  * `fs_write_i32() -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `fs.write`.
* **Networking**:

  * `net_tcp(host: str, port: i32) -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `net.tcp`.
  * `net_ping_i32() -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `net`.
* **Randomness**:

  * `rand_range(lo: i32, hi: i32) -> i32` ‚Äî gate: `rand`.

---

## 11. Purposes & Use Cases

* **Embedded & Real-time**: microcontrollers, avionics, robotics (durations, sleep).
* **Systems Programming**: OS kernels, drivers (asm integration, zero-overhead).
* **Security / Audited Code**: explicit capabilities (gates).
* **Networking / Protocol Engines**: explicit effect declaration, deterministic error handling.
* **HPC & Games**: predictable hot loops, inline asm for optimization.
* **Safety-Critical Systems**: medical, industrial controllers (type safety, quarantine).

## 13. Philosophy

* **Safety and power should not conflict**: everything that is safe erases to nothing at runtime.
* **Side-effects should be auditable**: gates make it impossible to sneak in I/O or randomness.
* **Errors should not crash by default**: quarantines make containment first-class.
* **The machine is yours**: inline asm, multi-output, hot hints ‚Äî no abstraction penalty.

## 14. Example ‚ÄúHero Program‚Äù

```inn
type State is enum { Idle, Working(i32), Failed(str) };

fn main() -> i32 with [fs.open, net.tcp, rand, time] is
  -- open a file
  let fd: i32 := fs_open("config.txt");

  -- compute with random
  let seed: i32 := rand_range(1, 100);

  -- inline asm for optimization
  let (a, b): (i32, i32) := asm {
    intel;
    outs ={eax}(_), ={ebx}(_);
    ins i(seed), i(fd);
    body: mov eax, seed; mov ebx, fd; add eax, ebx;
  };

  -- simulate network
  let code: i32 := net_tcp("example.com", 443);

  -- state machine with match
  let st: State := if (code > 0) then State.Working(a+b) else State.Failed("net error");

  let res: i32 := match st is
    case Working(v) when (v > 10) =>
      yield v;
    case Failed(msg) =>
      yield -1;
    default =>
      yield 0;
  end;

  quarantine risky is
    sleep(500 ms);
    fail;
  end;

  if isfailed("risky") then
    return -99;
  else
    return res;
  end
end
```
